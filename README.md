# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.


- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need three backticks (```)
- not to be confused with single qoutation (''')
```
if pwd == 'apple':
    print('Logging on ...')
else:
    print('Incorrect password.')

print('All done!')
```

- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks

```python
if pwd == 'apple':
    print('Logging on ...')
else:
    print('Incorrect password.')

print('All done!')
```
